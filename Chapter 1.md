|Symbol|Family of Variables |

| p | Parameters |
| u | Controllable inputs |
| w | Uncontrollable inputs (disturbances) |
| x | Dynamic states |
| y | Process outputs |
| n | Measurement errors |

*Open-loop control* - No path from **x** to **u** (Process is subjected to control inputs (**u**) without regard for state (**x**). Must be adequately "controllable" for 
*Closed-loop control* - Includes feedback information (i.e. through dynamic states **x**).
